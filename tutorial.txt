# Digustator Tutorial

Welcome to Planet X-7, the testing ground for humanity's newest profession: the digustator.

Your mission is simple - determine what's edible and what's not by consuming strange alien substances. Each item you eat will give you money, but also effects that can be positive, negative, or... unpredictable.

## Basic Mechanics

- **Play**: Start your digustator journey
- **Tutor**: View this tutorial text
- **Eat/Not Eat**: Each round you'll decide whether to consume the offered item
- **Effects**: Positive effects (like Temporary Immortality) can save you, while negative effects (like Poisoned) will harm you
- **Starvation**: Skipping too many items will make you starve
- **Shop**: Every 3 rounds you can visit the shop to buy helpful items

Good luck, and try not to die too many times!
