## Tutorial

On the new planet X-7, there are many items and things to check for edibility.

Your mission is simple - to determine what is edible and what is not,
                by eating strange alien substances.
If you refuse to eat, you won't get money for sustenance.

## Core Mechanics

- Round: In each round, you decide whether to consume the offered item.
- Choice Result: If you decide to eat, you get money for it.
- Effect: Eating items is not always safe, so you will be affected
                by various effects.
- Hunger: Skipping too many items will lead to starvation and death.
- Shop: Buy researched items and immediately eat them to
                avoid dying from scripts.hunger!
Good luck, and try not to die after the first taste!
